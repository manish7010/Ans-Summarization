# QUERY-GUIDED MULTI-PERSPECTIVE ANSWER SUMMARIZATION

In this project, We focus on generating a fluent and concise answer summary that includes all perspectives of all the answers on a community question-answering forum. To break down the problem, query-guided refers to using the question as a guide for summarization, while multiperspective refers to using the perspective from each of the multiple available answers to produce a single summarized answer.
